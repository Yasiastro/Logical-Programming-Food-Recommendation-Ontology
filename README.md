## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive food ontology written in OWL (Web Ontology Language). It aims to provide a standardized vocabulary and semantic structure for describing food products, ingredients, personalized nutritional recommendations to support healthy eating through a comprehensive food ontology and related concepts.

## Technical Details
- Written in OWL (Web Ontology Language)
- Developed using Protégé [version]
- [Other technical specifics]

## Installation and Usage
[Provide instructions on how to download, install, and use the ontology]

## Features
The ontology can answer various queries, including:
- Recommending dishes based on ingredients, nutrition, calorie content, and dietary categories (e.g., high protein, vegan).
- Considering user allergies and diseases for personalized dish recommendations.

## Key Classes
- **Dish**: Includes subclasses like Named_Dish and various defined classes based on features such as calorie content and dietary restrictions.
- **Nutrition**: Covers carbohydrates, fats, fibers, proteins, minerals, and vitamins.

- **User**: Represents user preferences and dietary restrictions.
- **Disease**: Consider the health conditions of users before make any recomendation.

## Relationships
- **hasIngredient**: Connects dishes to their ingredients.
- **hasNutrient**: Links ingredients to their nutritional content.
- **servedAsMeal**: Specifies when a dish can be served (e.g., breakfast, lunch, dinner).

## Property Restrictions
- Utilizes property restrictions like existential and universal quantifiers to define complex dishes, vegan dishes, and more.

## Applications
The ontology can be applied in various domains, including restaurants, the food industry, and domestic settings.

## Examples
[Include some example queries or use cases]

## Authors and Contributions
This project builds on works by several authors, including Dooley et al., and utilizes methodologies from Horridge et al. and Neuhaus & Brodaric.
