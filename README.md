 # Logical-Programming-Food-Antology-OWL
 Food recommendation Ontology, designed to personalized nutritional recommendations which effectively support healthy eating, through a food domain ontology. In this project logical programming languages such as, Prolog and Protege are used.

 
### I. INTRODUCTION

 This project presents the food recommendation Ontology, designed to personalized nutritional recommendations which effectively support healthy eating, through a food domain ontology. Disease of the users, their allergies, interests and their necessary nutrients have been considered. Dishes have been classified based on their nutrition, preparation complexity, amount of calorie, sugar and salt. In the following, the details of the projects, graphs and queries will be presented.

### II. DISCUSSION

The key terms of food ontology considered in this work are Dish, Ingredients, Meal, Nutrition, Level of Spicy, Side Dish, User and Disease. Some meaningful relations exist between classes and their subclasses. Fig.1 is showing in ontology metrics and Fig. 2 describes the overall class hierarchy that is considered in this work.
